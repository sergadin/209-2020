Shinedown - Call me

Wrap me in a bolt of lightning
Send me on my way still smiling
Maybe that's the way I should go
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left a spare key on the table
I never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
I lost my whole life and a dear friend
I've said it so many times
I would change my way
No nevermind
God knows I've tried
Call me a sinner
Call me a saint
Tell me it's over
I'll still love you the same
Call me your favourite
Call me the worst
Tell me it's over
I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
I finally put it all together
That nothing really lasts forever
I had to make a choice that was not mine
I had to say goodbye for the last time
I put my life in a suitcase
Never really stayed in one place
Maybe that's the way it should be
You know I've lived my life like a gypsy
I've said it so many times
I would change my ways, no never mind
God knows I tried
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me its over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite
Call me the worst
Tell me its over I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
I'll always keep you inside
You healed my heart and my life
And you know I've tried
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me its over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite
Call me the worst
Tell me its over I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way

Shinedown - I'll follow you

If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
And all my doubt is a staircase for you
Opened out of this maze
The first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound

I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you down
You can have the money and the world
The angels and the pearls
Even trademark the color blue
Just like the tower we never built
And the shadow of all guilt
When the other hand was pointed at you

Yeah the first step is the one you believe in
And the second one might be profound

I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace

I'll follow you down 
To where forever lies
Without a doubt I'm on your side
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
I'm not about to compromise 
Give you up and say goodbye
I've got you through the deep
I'll keep you close to me!

I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you

If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
I'll follow you down...

Shinedown - Diamond Eyes

I am the shadow, and the smoke in your eyes,
I am the ghost, that hides in the night

Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!

Wait, wait a minute take a step back
You gotta think twice before you react
So stay, stay a little while
Because a Promise not kept is the road to exile
Hey! whats the circumstance
You'll never be great without taking a chance so
Wait, you waited too long
Had your hands in your pocket
When you shoulda been gone

Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
One push is all you'll need
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
A fist first philosophy
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
We watch with wounded eyes
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
So I hope you recognize

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

Damn! damn it all down
Took one to the chest without even a sound so
What! What are you worth?
The things you love or the people you hurt
Hey! it's like deja vu
A suicidal maniac with nothing to lose
So wait, it's the exception to the rule
Everyone of us is expendable

Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
One push is all you'll need
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
A fist first philosophy
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
We watch with wounded eyes
Boom-Lay Boom-Lay BOOM!
So I hope you recognize

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I know that I'm alive

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

Every night of my life
I watch angels fall from the sky
Every time that the sun still sets
I pray they don't take mine

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to regret
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regrets
And now I know that I'm alive

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes
